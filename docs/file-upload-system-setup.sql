============================================================
STORAGE BUCKET CONFIGURATION
============================================================

Create bucket in Supabase Dashboard > Storage with:
{
  "name": "documents",
  "id": "documents",
  "public": false,
  "file_size_limit": 104857600,
  "allowed_mime_types": [
    "application/pdf",
    "text/plain",
    "text/markdown",
    "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
  ]
}

[Note: Or create via API using service role key]

============================================================
SETUP COMPLETE
============================================================

After executing the SQL:
1. Verify tables created: uploaded_files, file_content, file_rpe_relationships,
   file_processing_sessions, file_tags
2. Verify storage bucket 'documents' created
3. Deploy upload-file edge function
